# AI-Avatar

This project was made for The Next School Teen Talwar's Open House. The file titled voice-gpt-synthesia-wo-jason.py is the final working file for running this project. Run this file in the terminal using python command and then log into your Synthesia account for viewing the final output there. For this project, you will need OpenAI, Synthesia API keys saved in a separate .env file as follows: OPENAI_API_KEY= 
SYNTHESIA_API_KEY= 
You will need to create a .env file in the project's directory. You can change the attributes' values in the Payload (line 57) to change different parameters of Synthesia (e.g. avatar's voice, face, gender, etc.)
File titled AIAvatar.py is a work-in-progress: this was created to be able to display the Synthesia output on a GUI, like Streamlit. Hence, to run this file, use this command on the terminal: streamlit run AIAvatar.py
